In the far Northeast corner of the state, Sheridan County Conservation District (SCCD) has a unique program that is essential to the areaâ€™s water management, especially as droughts across the West continue to worsen. The Clear Lake Aquifer occupies this region and is a significant water resource for the area. Thousands of acres of lakes and wetland overlay this groundwater and create important migratory bird and wildlife habitat, but farmers, ranchers and the community also depend on this water.

Starting in 1994, SCCD was authorized by DNRC to manage 15,479 acre/feet of the aquifer. Of this 15,479, SCCD may allocate the use of up to 10,000 acre/feet through permits for irrigation or stock water. In order to understand the impacts of allocating this water, SCCD has developed an effective water management and monitoring program.

Through this program, staff at Sheridan County Conservation District monitors the static water levels of the aquifer once a month, roughly March-November. There are 180 monitoring wells and pivots total throughout the aquifer, 80 of which have data loggers that report data on static water levels each hour. SCCD does some of the data interpretation, however all data is sent to the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology (MBMG) where it is put on their [public website](https://mbmggwic.mtech.edu/). MBMG also further analyzes data and uses it to make appropriate recommendations for future irrigation sites.

Currently, the 10,000-acre/feet permitting allotment is enough to meet community demands. However according to SCCD staff member Amy Yoder, if drought continues, the number of producers requesting water for irrigation increases, or other competing users come into play, demand may not be fully met. The monitoring program must ensure that water levels are not drawn down too much and that recharge from spring snow melt is sufficient. Continued monitoring of the ground and surface water is needed to decide whether the remaining 5,479-acre/feet can be developed in these scenarios where demand is not met.

The program not only helps ensure the water is not overused, but also provides data that informs management of wildlife habitat on the US Fish and Wildlife Service Medicine Lake Refuge. Thus, this program helps accomplish a good balance between community need for water resources and conservation of the water for wildlife habitat.
