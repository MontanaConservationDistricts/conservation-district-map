  The Lower Musselshell Conservation District provides private landowners in
  Golden Valley, Musselshell, and parts of Rosebud county with the tools,
  education, and resources to implement conservation practices which protect and
  promote the wise use of our natural resources. We are a partner of the Montana
  Association of Conservation Districts and the [Big Sky Watershed Corps
  Program](http://mtwatersheds.org/Services/BigSkyWatershedCorps.html). The
  conservation district works with and provides fiscal sponsorship for
  the [Musselshell Watershed
  Coalition](https://lmcdistrict.wordpress.com/musselshell-watershed-coalition/) –
  an informal partnership of landowners, water users associations, conservation
  districts, state and federal agencies in the Musselshell Valley. 


  The conservation district is overseen by a board of supervisors. These supervisors are elected and volunteer their time. Meetings are held on the third Thursday of every month at 7:30 p.m. A part-time administrator to handles the day-to-day operations of the conservation district. The district hosts a Big Sky Watershed Corps member who assists with water quality monitoring, education, outreach, and coordination throughout the Musselshell Watershed. The district’s fuel mitigation program is overseen by a part-time forester.
