  The mission of the 'Lewis and Clark Conservation District' is to provide
  leadership in the conservation and wise use of natural resources to the people
  of Lewis and Clark County, Montana.


  The work of the 'Lewis and Clark Conservation District' encompasses aspects of water, plant and people resources.  Community education and active involvement in projects and programs related to these resources.


  The District not only implements the "310 Law" in Lewis and Clark County, doing permitting for private projects on streams and rivers, and the reservoirs on the Missouri River, but they also are actively involved in promotion of using willow soil lifts, and other bioengineering techniques to restore stream and river banks in the county. They are involved in the Lake Helena Watershed Group and the Sun River Watershed Group.


  They value locally led conservation and rely on landowners in the county to assist in planning and project work. They also value collaboration with partners of all sorts to stretch budgets and get critical work done in the county.


  The Conservation District has a quarterly electronic newsletter, *[The Explorer](https://lewisandclarkcd.org/landowner-resources/newsletter/)*, annual workshops, and participation in youth and adult education programs encompassing riparian grazing, stream and river health, soil health, pollinators and more. They also work with their state legislators, informing them of current resource issues and challenges in their area.


  District staff work remotely for the most part, so call or email to make an appointment to meet at the office. Chris Evans, Administrator, 406-502-8591, chris@lewisandclarkcd.org, or Joe Kremer-Herman, Resource Specialist, 406-594-9823, joe@lewisandclarkcd.org.
