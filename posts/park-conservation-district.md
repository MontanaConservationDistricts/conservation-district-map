  The Park Conservation District Supervisors’ goal, in partnership with the
  NRCS, is to guide Park County in the conservation and management of soil,
  water, cropland, grazing lands, weeds and small acreages by providing
  leadership in conservation planning, technical assistance, education
  resources, and resource management tools and inventories.


  One of the Park CD’s main responsibilities is upholding the 310 Law. Under this law, all activity directly on perennial streams or its banks must have a 310 permit before the action is taken. The Park CD processes these permits, inspects the proposed project site, and approves, modifies or denies the project. For more information, see the [310 permit information page](http://www.parkcd.org/?page_id=171 "310 Permits").


  Park CD has has also supported the formation of two watershed groups:  the [Upper Yellowstone Watershed Basin](http://www.parkcd.org/?page_id=57) (UYWB) and the [Shields Valley Watershed Group](http://www.parkcd.org/?page_id=60) (SVWG). It is also a partner with the [Park County Cooperative Weed Management Area](http://parkcountycwma.com/). Park CD also works with local schools, 4H participants, and other community members to put on or communicating educational events and opportunities happening throughout the county.
