summary: The Beaverhead Conservation District was formed in 1950 by local
  citizens to provide technical assistance to landowners in carrying out soil
  and water conservation practices. The conservation district works with
  stakeholders in southwest Montana to protect natural resources through
  sustainable agriculture, 310 permitting, and conservation. Beaverhead CD is a
  partner of the [Beaverhead Watershed
  Committee](https://beaverheadcd.org/category/featured/) and [Beaverhead County
  Collaborative](https://beaverheadcd.org/category/beaverhead-county-collaborative/).
