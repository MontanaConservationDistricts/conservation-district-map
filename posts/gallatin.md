title: Gallatin County Conservation District
date: 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
author: Eric Rannestad
summary: Gallatin Conservation District is a subdivision of state government and
  receives the majority of funds through a county tax assessment on real
  property.  A landowner with property valued at $100,000 can expect to pay
  approximately $1.00 a year in tax to the GCD. A non-paid elected board of five
  supervisors and two appointed urban supervisors governs district business. The
  GCD also appoints Associate Supervisors who serve as advisories to the board.
  The GCD covers all portions of the county except the major portions of the
  cities of Belgrade and Bozeman. Click here for Bozeman map. Click here for
