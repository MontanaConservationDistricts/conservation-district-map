The Rosebud Conservation District regularly hosts a meeting of local people to give feedback on the state of natural resources, environmental concerns, and provide opportunities to address environmental problems with meaningful solutions.  Rosebud Conservation District uses this information to support grant requests and help the local Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) prioritize local funding opportunities.

This year the Rosebud Conservation District has elected to get your feedback via a survey, included below.  You can complete the survey by hand and mail or deliver it to the Rosebud Conservation District in Forsyth OR you can call the Rosebud conservation office, and someone will visit with you over the phone and record your input.

Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback so that we can help ensure our activities and the activities of our partners are as positive for the people of Rosebud County as possible.  We will consider all of the responses we receive before July 1, 2022 in our next planning sessions.
