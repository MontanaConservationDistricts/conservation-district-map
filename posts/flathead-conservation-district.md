  With close ties to local landowners and partnering organizations, the
  Flathead Conservation District works to address the county’s natural resource
  concerns through land-owner assistance and education programs. We work with
  small and large acreage landowners, educators and students as well as local,
  state and federal partners to accomplish the goals of improving and promoting
  the stewardship of the lands and waters in Flathead County.
