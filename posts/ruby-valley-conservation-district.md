# Ramshorn Creek Restoration

#### **Area Summary**

Ramshorn Creek is a tributary to the Ruby River. It runs for approximately 14.7 miles from its headwaters in the Southern Tobacco Root Mountains to its confluence with the Ruby River above Silver Springs. Currant Creek is a 3.6 mile tributary to Ramshorn Creek. The upper reaches of Ramshorn Creek hold remnant westslope cutthroat trout populations. This remnant population holds potential for fishery restoration but is also vulnerable to downstream introductions of non-native fish.
