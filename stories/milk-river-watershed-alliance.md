summary: Beneficiaries of the Milk River span not only counties, but nations.
  Into Canada and through Tribal Nations, from irrigators, ranchers, cities and
  communities, and recreationists, the Milk River’s impact is incalculable.

You would be hard-pressed to find someone in Montana that is unaware of the St. Mary’s Diversion and what is happening on the Milk River. Without that diversion system near Babb, Montana, all infrastructure downstream becomes almost irrelevant; millions of tax-payer dollars down the drain, with the economic impact on local communities insurmountable. For decades, groups have been warning of failure should the system go unchecked. Last May those warnings became a stark reality: complete failure of a major drop-structure that carries water to the Milk. Some might not realize that the diversion at St. Mary’s prevents the Milk River from running dry every six of ten years; it is understandable why one system would cause such a great concern among residents in North and Northeast Montana.

Beneficiaries of the Milk River span not only counties, but nations. Into Canada and through Tribal Nations, from irrigators, ranchers, cities and communities, and recreationists, the Milk River’s impact is incalculable.

The water from the Milk River sustains approximately 693 farms and entire municipalities that total more than 18,000 people. With so many beneficiaries, who is responsible for maintenance? The United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation ultimately retains ownership of the irrigation infrastructure on the Milk River. However, the financial responsibility falls almost all on irrigators. Since the Project was developed, the Milk River Irrigators have had to pay 73.96% of all repairs made, and the USBR (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation) pays the rest. This cost-share is critical because the entire diversion needs to be repaired and comes with a price tag of nearly $200 million. It doesn’t take much to realize that those irrigators don’t have $50 million ready to break ground.

Efforts at the federal level have been pushed for years to see an amended cost-share allocation to allow for repairs to be made. Though repairs would be a tremendous investment, the economic loss should the Milk River infrastructure fail would be far more expensive. In a 2006 study, it was concluded that the economy could suffer up to a $2 billion loss should that happen. Though repairs to the drop-structure last year were accomplished through an emergency arrangement and hefty financing, waiting for another failure for another fix is not a wise solution. House Joint Resolution No. 7 was introduced by Rep. Casey Knudsen of Malta in February and soared through the Montana Legislature. This Resolution calls on the Federal Government to adjust the current funding allocation to ensure affordability, and ultimately infrastructure rehabilitation. With strong support from conservation districts, sportsmen and wildlife advocates, bankers, farmers and numerous governmental agencies, H.J. No. 7 is just one collaborative effort between stakeholders to make change and its passage was considered a huge success.

You can find the passed Resolution language on our website: milkrivermt.org. Additionally, Senator Tester, Senator Daines and Representative Rosendale have recently reintroduced federal legislation to not only provide $52 million in contribution to repairs, but to also reassess the current cost-share between irrigators and USBR. While efforts like this have been tried before without success, the failure at St. Mary’s has demonstrated that complete disaster is a reality for those along the Hi-Line, and therefore needs immediate consideration and action.

We are hoping more and more people will join the call to repair and protect the St. Mary’s Diversion and the Milk River Project. The Milk River Watershed Alliance is proud to share a video that highlights the challenges and champions of the Milk River, available on our website at milkrivermt.org. Please consider sharing this video with friends, family and community leadership. A call to our Montana Congressional Delegation will also go a long way; don’t let them forget how important this issue is. We cannot let this momentum run out.
