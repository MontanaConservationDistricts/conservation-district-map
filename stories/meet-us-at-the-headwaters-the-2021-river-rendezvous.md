The Missouri River Conservation Districts Council, in partnership with Gallatin Conservation District and Broadwater Conservation District, held the 2021 River Rendezvous in the Gallatin Valley. Planning for this event began in 2020, but due to the COVID pandemic, was postponed until this year. It was well worth the wait! 

The purpose of the River Rendezvous event is to educate local and statewide partners, leaders, and stakeholders of natural resource concerns about a segment effecting the Missouri River Watershed. This year’s event was held at the Headwaters of the Missouri in the Gallatin Valley around Bozeman, Montana.

The day started with a presentation about private pond proliferation, an increasing concern of water rights and potential introductions of invasive species and diseases into natural water ways. Next, we traveled to Hyalite Reservoir and listened to a speaker panel about all the different uses of the reservoir including recreation, agriculture irrigation, City of Bozeman, and dam flow. We followed this up at the City of Bozeman’s other main water source with a tour and information about Sourdough Creek and Trailhead. Gallatin Conservation District showed great hospitality by providing lunch at their Education and Outreach Center in Manhattan. Their projects and demonstrations are top notch! 

To finish the day, we visited the Missouri Headwaters State Park. This is where the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison and Gallatin Rivers occurs, starting the Missouri River. At this location, there was a presentation about USDA-NRCS and Conservation District partnerships and one from a park ranger who shared history and information about the confluence and state park.
