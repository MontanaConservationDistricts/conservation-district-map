This year the Central & Eastern Montana Invasive Species Team (CEMIST) is conducting an all taxa invasive species education & outreach program. The program focuses on raising awareness amongst the community, recreators, and industry leaders about the threats and impacts of various invasive species to Montana’s economy and natural resources. Aquatic invasive species, noxious weeds, invasive plants, forest pests, and feral swine all threaten Montana’s economy and natural resources. By incorporating the various invasive species prevention campaigns adopted by the state, we are able to get stakeholders, community members, and outdoor recreators to actively participate in the prevention of invasive species to new areas of the state. People and their activities are the primary vectors of spread when it comes to invasive species and the more that we can raise the awareness level of these threats, the better protected our natural resources are going to be.

By attending various educational events with local school groups, CEMIST is looking to get the next generation involved with the conservation and preservation of Montana’s amazing resources. Leaders in the agriculture and outdoor recreation industries have been engaged by conducting industry outreach site visits in order to educate them on the various invasive species threats, impacts, and prevention practices. The purpose of these industry outreach site visits is to raise the awareness level of invasive species prevention practices amongst communities that are most likely to spread invasive species. CEMIST is also attending local community events such as the Craig Caddis Festival, State Fair, and the Stock Growers Association Convention to bolster invasive species outreach efforts throughout the state. CEMIST outreach efforts were also featured on the Great Falls Tourism podcast ‘We’re No Dam Experts’ in [Episode 37: That’s What Tree Said](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3dlcmVub2RhbWV4cGVydHMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/YTRhMzMwZDMtZmEwZi00MTcyLTkxMTAtMjhiYjI0ZWI5MDZh?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjjrJGkrdzyAhU6EDQIHdRTD9kQjrkEegQIBxAI&ep=6).

CEMIST members recently received training in aquatic invasive species early detection and monitoring training from FWP. The group will be participating in aquatic invasive species surveying and monitoring efforts in 5 regions in Montana with major watersheds that significantly contribute to Montana’s economy each year. This is important because aquatic invasive species can have huge effects on the state’s two primary industries: 1) agriculture and 2) outdoor recreation. For example, the estimated cost of the introduction of invasive mussels to Montana would be $234 million annually (DNRC). Whereas, the state currently only spends $6.5 million annually on prevention efforts which is only approximately 3% of the cost of introduction of these invasive mussels (DNRC).
